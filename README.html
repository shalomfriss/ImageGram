<p>Simple HTMLElement extensions with instagram style filters. These can be used interchangeably with an img tag.
For examples look at index.html. The filter css was gotten from CSSGram (http://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elements) with minor modifications on a few of the filters in order to simplify them. Note, this was built using custom elements which are
not yet widely supported but will be in the future (http://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elements). </p>

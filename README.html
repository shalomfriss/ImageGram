<p>Simple HTMLElement extensions with instagram style filters. These can be used interchangeably with an img tag.
For examples look at index.html. </p>

<p>The filter css was gotten from CSSGram (https://una.im/CSSgram/) with minor modifications on a few of the filters in order to simplify them. </p>

<p>Note, this was built using custom elements which are not yet widely supported but will be in the future (http://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elements). </p>

# ImageGram
Simple HTMLElement extensions with instagram style filters. These can be used interchangeably with an img tag. 
For examples look at index.html.  

The filter css was gotten from CSSGram (https://una.im/CSSgram/) with minor modifications on a few of the filters in order to simplify them.  

Note, this was built using custom elements which are not yet widely supported but will be in the future (http://caniuse.com/#feat=custom-elements).  Also, ImageBase.js is the base class for all the filters, it must always
be included.
